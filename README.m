# CSS143-DataStructures
Build three classes that conform to the following interfaces. Use arrays 
in creating your classes (e.g., do not use the built-in ArrayList class 
when creating the ArrayList-like interface). Extend the sample driver 
below to completely test the FIFO nature of a Queue, the LIFO nature of a
stack and the arbitrary inserts and removes in an ArrayList-like structure.
